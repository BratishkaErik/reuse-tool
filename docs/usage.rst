Usage
=====

The :doc:`overview <readme>` documents some basic usage on how to use this tool.
It is highly recommended to read the overview first, and you might not even need
to read this chapter. This chapter covers details that might not be immediately
obvious when using the tool. This chapter does not cover *everything*, assuming
that the user is helped enough by ``reuse --help`` and ``reuse <subcommand>
--help``.
